## Software

```r
# datRSTUDIO <- rstudioapi::versionInfo()
# saveRDS(datRSTUDIO, file = "./data/rStudioDATAinfo.rds")
# datRSTUDIO <- readRDS("./data/rStudioDATAinfo.rds")
```

###### R version

R is currently running `r #eval = FALSE #datRSTUDIO` and Rstudio ...`r #eval = FALSE #datRSTUDIO`

##### R Packages

One of the strengths of working in R is that all the packages and other software needed to develop the operational R libraries (CRAN packages) all open-source and free. The downside of open source science can be the difficultly to reproduce more experimental packages on servers such as `github`.

For the PhD planning template I have began with a `tidyverse` approach and added the additional R packages (as stable as possible) to the notes below. These additional packages are:

*[code here for all packages used....]*

###### `tidyverse`

The general concept of `tidyverse` is to create a collection of R packages that make the following workflow below straightforward, at least in the sense of R functions instead of writing all the functions by hand.

###### `diagrammR`

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)
```

###### `dataspice`

```{r child = "data/dataSpice4stepGuide.Rmd", eval = T}
library(dataspice)
```

###### `rmarkdown`

[rmarkdown basics]

###### `bookdown`

[bookdown basics]

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this example into HTML. You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html.

###### `tidyPipes`

[My package under personal development]: Overall, there isn't any methods beyond getting all of my appointments and timelines into a single format to be able to plan my `phd` work and other projects developed around this work.

See the `tidyPipes` manual for more details on the choice of structure and representation.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# datRSTUDIO <- rstudioapi::versionInfo()
# saveRDS(datRSTUDIO, file = "./data/rStudioDATAinfo.rds")
# datRSTUDIO <- readRDS("./data/rStudioDATAinfo.rds")

datR <- R.Version()
