["index.html", "A PhD template for tasks and timelines in a COVID19 world 1 Overview 1.1 Proposal", " A PhD template for tasks and timelines in a COVID19 world Anthony Davidson 2020-11-10 1 Overview Constructing, managing and submitting PhD timelines can be a time consuming and often fruitless venture. I have found that creating realistic timelines, tasklists and milestones for graduate research hard to produce due to unpredictable outcomes of research (e.g time taken to collect data and produce results and publish results). This has been made even more challenging under COVID19 conditions because of the unpredictable nature of the disease and the impacts of the pandemic both economically and socially throughout the community. Note: Orginally I wanted to create a simple shiny dashboard that automatically generates a reproducible report including an integrated task, milestone and time management system for graduate research planning with examples from my own PhD work. 1.1 Proposal This repository is a draft of the baseline approach I am using for my own time management for the last 6months of my PhD but could easily extended to similar graduate research, professional projects and consulting situations. 1.1.0.1 Outputs The results of the scripts and functions within this repository are focused around the baseline dataset and different combinations of these core variables. The baseline dataset (name: ) and core code has been developed and extended from other open source science projects. 1.1.0.1.1 Stage One: Baseline dataset Each individual graduate student will have a collection of data, methods and tools needed to conceptualize, create and produce a thesis however by structuring a timeline around key dates (milestones) within the same task lists database. This database is based on a simple collection of key variables. To begin with, the standard milestones and key dates can be generated based of each individuals unique starting date using an extension of Bernd’s script: Milestones Timeline This function generates a timeline from the baseline dataset grouped by chapter impact or status…. Task lists 1.1.0.1.2 Stage two (updated Oct 2020) August2020: I developed this idea further down the track of an interactive web application using shiny. July2020: I developed this idea further down the track of an interactive web application using shiny. June2019: This could be done by hand but I have extended Bernds idea of a timeline etc in R for PhD candidates to include better visualisations and other key points. I see this as being an interactive tool for future candidates if I can find funding to annotate the code properly so someone else with no R knowledge can navigate this. 1.1.0.1.3 Future stages With the support of other users there is potential to develop the proposed structure here to create the following extensions of this work. 1.1.0.1.3.1 Stage three Visualise and publish interactive report for SciTech Students. STATUS: [Example of my Phd currently in development] 1.1.0.1.3.2 Stage four Intergrate Outlook emails and tasks STATUS: [currently methods draft] 1.1.0.1.3.3 Stage five Intergrate Microsoft planner STATUS: [currently methods draft] 1.1.0.1.3.4 Stage six Internal publishing on uni intranet.[currently methods draft] Possible University of Canberra outputs - Progress Report - APR - Research Review - Scholarship applications - Timelines - Future tasklists/goals 1.1.0.1.4 Side projects [coming] SEE thetidyPipes MANUAL for general concept and approach. This repository contains example data and scripts needed to visualize and communicate multiple different projects including: ACTSeedlings/[coming] DynamicCVs/[coming] flatttingRMDstlyle/ (a repository for documenting and recording reproducible reports for my flatting arrangements). PhDplanningRMDstyle/ (the documentation and reporting for the final 6months of my PhD). "],
["intro.html", " 2 Background", " 2 Background There are multiple difference sources of information for this calendar. To be able to keep this upto date and current I have developed scripts for each unique data-source to my database of events ([coming])). Timeline figures can include information on past and future Actions Milestones Tasks The purpose of this repository is to show how, with references to “real-world applications”reproducible timelines and tasklists, and timetables for research projects. I have assumed that you have installed the nessacery packages following instructions in the README. strengths The strength of this approach is that I can personally keep on top of my tasks, goals and timelines for my PhD research. future development And additional possibility is that this template can be scaled to work for all of SciTech, UC or maybe even global graduates. Generally, this work is focused on writing the scripts to automate the integration between emails, PhD timeline and other projects. To do this we need to import datasets and modify the structure of these inputs to match the information needed to construct a timeline of tasks and objectives. "],
["method.html", " 3 Methods", " 3 Methods The method to this approach is a combination of computer science, ecology and tertery education research to create a accessable, open-source and reproducible timeline, tasklist and milestones as research project develop and evolve into finalised results. Generally, the baseline dataset can be viewed as time series data. A good general tutorial for time series data is here on youtube. There are several packages to visualise timeseries data in R, below are selected sections of code that generate the timeline, tasklists and mileestones. Overall there are two generalised datasets that may be helpful to other individuals for each project or combination of projects (for the APR for example). The baseline dataset is found in the .xlsx file named “baseline-dataset-calender.xlsx”. This is the base file I have been adding information to when I change the overall structure of the calendar projects. The data for this collection of tasks associated with timelines and targets. 3.0.1 Data Generally the concept is to create a baseline dataset of information and then extend this using dataspice to create a tidy format of data that can then be modelled and visualised using the tidyverse suite of tools. To begin with I have collated and restructured the avaliable data from downloaded .ics data as a csv and the UCSRC council calendar. This sorted data was orginally saved as “baseline-dataset-calender.xlsx” but as I couldnt get the xcel package to work nicely I converted each project dataset into a csv file stored in the ./data/ folder. IS THIS LOGICAL - scalable? The baseline dataset for this report/analysis is generated from the a collection of data sources including calendars, online storage, planner, oneNote and outlook (others to come) task database. This is defined by the combination of projects and eventCode variables. 📂data ┣ 📂metadata {files generated from the dataspice ┣ collection of applications} ┣ ┣ 📂pdfs {directly linked pdf resources for the ┣ planning repository} ┣ ┣ 📂ucTemplates {orginally proposed assessment ┣ templates from University of ┣ Canberra} ┣ ┣ 📂raw_data {any raw data that a user wants to add. THis can then be transformed into the same structure as the baseline dataset using a R script for that translation} Found in the ./data/ folder. Raw data from the original sources can be found in the ./raw_data/. The meta-data associated with the transformation of the raw data into the baseline dataset can be found in the README.Rmd file in each folder. This baseline dataset is documented using dataspice package and the following steps: ┣ 📜fullPhDdatasetAUG2020.csv ┣ 📜keydatesBERND.csv ┣ 📜newCouncilTasks.csv ┣ 📜reportcalendar.csv ┣ 📜reportdatatimeline.csv ┣ 📜reportdatatimelineALL.csv ┣ 📜reportmilestonesALL.csv ┣ 📜reportTaskList.csv ┣ 📜reportTaskListDEMO.csv ┣ 📜reportTaskListDEMOpivot.csv ┣ 📜reportTaskListDEMOpivotPLUS.xlsx ┗ 📜tableOuput.csv 3.0.1.1 Baseline dataset.csv Generally the data can be imported as a csv, or other forms. 3.0.1.2 Variable structure To help break the tasks down I have defined an event of importance to my SciTech application with several core variables that help with visualisation and grouping of tasks. This template is scalable and can be modified for each project/PhD candidate however if the core variables are modified in there naming properties the current reproducible report will not run. 3.0.1.2.1 eventCode Each unique task/project/goal has an eventCode. This event code is comprised of the general area (i.e phd) then pasted together with date and 3 digit number depending on iteration of this. Note: This directly relates to the exported planner files unique event code. Currently the database for my PhD timeline consists of rlength(datCUR$eventCode) entries with 68 in the following groups: NOTE: Limitations? scale and replication? If we put strong naming conventions around the eventCode we may end up limiting the number of entries in a single workflow/pipeline. Currently input data can be added using teams and then exported here but have not worked out a way to import data constructed here unless I can access the sharepoint files through Microsoft Graph. Split by visualisation datasets in main data folder. 3.0.2 Baseline wrangling To visualise the dataset used for this planning toolwe need to filter, split and re-arrange the above baseline dataset. 3.0.2.1 Direction 3.0.2.2 Counts 3.0.2.3 Buffering times 3.0.3 Adding data sources… 3.0.3.1 Importing exCalendars For calendars the main issues are involved with the different types of applications available for viewing and managing different calendars are different for gmail, outlook and even within different windows programs. These are my notes on where my calendar appointments are currently held. 3.0.3.1.1 .iCal data 3.0.3.2 Microsoft planner Microsoft tools are commonly used for almost all aspect of academic research. Since 2019, Microsoft has integrated SharePoint, OneNote,Automate and Planner for task management and planning. My fortnightly timetable exploits the features of the Microsoft tools above and RStudio to create dynamic reports and interactive reports in the future. Provide a basic outline of tasks (Task column) to be completed for each chapter and how the required work will be completed and integrated into the chapter. Microsoft planner has the following headers: YAML(ish): x3 first three lines then space column names 3.0.4 Visualising database There are several aspects of the underlying baseline dataset that I have written functions/code for. 3.0.4.1 Milestones The simplist of the reduced datasets. This consists of the following columns: And filtered by only the Phd milestones using: 3.0.4.1.1 SHortcut Here to make this simplier for now I have just made a csv file for each chapter with the following headings… (these will later be turned into code to transform baseline into this). 3.0.4.2 Fortnightly timetable This is one of the most detailed tables the baseline dataset can create. This consists of the following variables: 3.0.4.3 Import lists on a dayly basis To do this simply write the “back” transformed baseline dataset to the format of mircosoft task likes Upload this csv file Look at new tasks and modify 3.0.4.4 Bernd Gurber’s IAE variation When I first began my canditure I was given a simple personalisable calendar. Throughout my canditidure I have updated and adding milestones to this information. 3.0.4.5 Variable names standard TEAMS AND SHAREPOINT ARE FUNNYLLLLLL explain in PhD planner repo online here. Full details should be given in the Description column. To do this I have reduced the baseline dataset into a smaller selected dataset of …. Description = explaination of task Task = shortName startDate = date task starts And then using R I have split the plots and a tab for each week in sections… Please also complete and attach, the Fortnightly Timeline, to your PhD Extension application. The simple excel template provided from the SciTech department is a good start but working with tasking and planning has been extended by many different variations and approaches. For a PhD the key aspects for project management from a template or tool is: Scalable Accessible Longevity/Versatility (Mac Windows etc…) image-20200831093037666 3.0.4.5.1 First fortnight To do this and proactively reduce distractions in PhD work I have created a reproducible workflow using the same tools I have developed for my PhD.A full “draft” manual can be found here:. 3.0.4.5.2 Second Fortnight 3.0.4.5.3 3rd Fortnight 3.0.4.6 Interactive dashboard In the future this should be an interactive dashboard. 3.0.4.7 Other data Bernds timeline is a full function that asks for a single name and starting date and produces a visual representation of the year using the following dataframe. ## [1] &quot;startDate&quot; &quot;status&quot; &quot;Chapter&quot; &quot;week&quot; &quot;shortName&quot; ## [6] &quot;GeneralDesc&quot; &quot;Tasks&quot; &quot;Notes&quot; &quot;trueDate&quot; &quot;Month_Year&quot; ## [1] &quot;X1&quot; &quot;year&quot; &quot;month&quot; &quot;yweek&quot; &quot;mweek&quot; &quot;yday&quot; ## [7] &quot;mday&quot; &quot;hour&quot; &quot;minute&quot; &quot;weekday&quot; &quot;bizday&quot; &quot;season&quot; ## [13] &quot;values&quot; &quot;week&quot; &quot;monthweek&quot; ## chr [1:20] &quot;2019-07&quot; &quot;2020-03&quot; &quot;2020-06&quot; &quot;2020-07&quot; &quot;2020-07&quot; &quot;2020-07&quot; ... Bernd and others have made timelines in R using the following R script: Aspects of this simple timeline are incoperated as so: 3.0.4.8 .xlsx These are excel workbooks. For now this is very simple and works with the current version of excel files (2020). Each “sheet” of the excel file contains a single projects information. This is then converted to a csv file when needed. In the future each project will have its own file that can be added to or modified in a shiny interactive web app. A key aspect of these R scripts is the date format. This has been challenging to work with but currently I have the following notes on the transformation of the date/time data from excel and manually (with csv file below). 3.0.4.9 Outlook There are many ways to download outlook data but the manual and simplist way is to make a folder and save everything you want to use in that folder. Then download this as a .csv file and use the code below to visualise the data directly. 3.0.4.10 .csv drafts folder To make this easy to begin with I have downloaded .csv files are in data and look like so: Sort out colomn names 3.0.4.10.1 Re-sturucture outlook data Maybe this can be generalised to ical data. 3.0.4.11 Gmail import 3.0.4.12 Microsoft planner Microsoft tools are commonly used for almost all aspect of academic research.
